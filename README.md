My Solutions to homework problems and programming assignments for Stanford's cs224w Machine Learning with Graphs (2021) course, [course webpage](https://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-2021/).
Big thanks to the actual course staff for making the course material available online.

I strongly recommend the following playlists to learn PyG for anyone doing the course- 
1. [Antonio Longa's PyTorch Geometric Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGMXrbDNfqTzqxB1IGgimuhtfAhGd8lHF)
2. [Antonio Longa's Advanced PyTorch Geometric Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGMXrbDNfqTwPxitLVHEbT9Pd6-oR_cud)

<b>NOTE</b>: I might have to remove this repo/make it private if anyone from Stanford contacts me. It happened with my cs229 repository, so you might find it helpful to download this as a zip.

<s>I am planning to upload typeset LaTeX solutions soon!</s>

[Update 09/2024], I have finally got extra time to typeset stuff, started with HW1, already.
- [ ] HW1
- [ ] HW2
- [ ] HW3

I also removed the slides because I saw that it takes forever to clone the repo.

If you find any discrepancies in the solutions, please feel free to write to me at my email! (set subject to "[cs224w]").
